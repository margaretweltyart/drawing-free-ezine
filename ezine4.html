<p>Here we GO! In this DrawingFree Ezine #4 I'm going to take you step-by-step from the start of drawing in the COLOR to the FINISH in this drawing that was started and laid out in <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/Ezine/ezine3.html" target="_blank">DrawingFree Ezine #3</a>. You will learn how to create wonderfully varied colors that are made slowly with light layers of color that shift and change as they are laid into the drawing.</p>

		<span class="number">1.</span> This first photo of "Bear, Butterfly, Bunny Drawing" was taken at the end of the DrawingFree Ezine #4 shoot.  Time passed and I later started to complete this drawing.  
Here you can see the light outlines of the transfered images.You can see that the center of the Flower has been worked (drawn on) a bit.  The first layer of the background has been drawn lightly in green colored pencil. This particular background extends down (from the top to the bottom) to become the foreground space as well.  
Note the very light initial development of the  green background. It is important to put your background in first -- it makes things so much easier later.  (Imagine drawing between each of the the branches of a tree that was drawn first!) 
So remember, background first!<br /><br />
Also note that this whole drawing will be (mostly) done only with the TWELVE colored pencils in <a href="http://www.prismacolor.com/home" target="_blank">Prismacolor's</a> smallest set.

	<div class="image_text">
		<span class="number">2.</span>I got carried away here -- in the best sense of the phrase -- and I kept drawing long before I stopped to take the second picture.  So there is quite a jump from the first drawing to the second.  My apologies!  
There is no right or wrong way to proceed when you start to put in the color.  What I do know is that I kind of started to sort of "see" a pattern forming in the light green background.  I followed what seemed to be there and made it more manifest.  When I  look at the proceeding picture -- I don't see this pattern in photo #1 -- but while drawing the next layer of the background -- in photo #2 -- it started to develop and you can see the beginnings of it here. 
More work on the forms: With a sharp edge or point to the pencils I also gave a very THIN outline to SOME (not all!) of the more shaded areas of the forms.  Where I would later make it darker or more shaded on the Bunny I used RED lines.  On the Bear and the Flower I used BLUE and on the Butterfly I applied some ORANGE to the darker colors of the Butterfly.  I already know that I will <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=knock_down" target="_blank">knock down</a> (dull out) the shadows that I have put here with their <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=complementary_colors" target="_blank">complementary colors</a>. Green will be put over the red.  A slight amount of blue will go over the orange/red of the Butterfly's areas.  The Bear will remain with his darker blue that will be against his brighter and lighter turquoise blue.  A bit of orange will be added later into some of the Bear's darker blues to dull them out a bit.  (See #16).

		<span class="number">3.</span>The Bear got lots more blue and then some white into his white/light areas that were left blank and without any blue for now.  Know where you are going to leave your whites - WHITE.  White will not color over another color and will not come back to being a clear white. A white colored pencil can also <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=burnish" target="_blank">burnish</a> and <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=burnish" target="_blank">blend</a>.  Working to keep a light hand and a light application, I hopefully don't have a heavy enough application to need to burnish!!   Some white added in without pressure will kind of blend and settle things in a bit.  It also puts a layer of colored pencil down over the paper where you may want it to remain white.  Experiment with white on a side paper to see what it does and how you want to handle it with other colors.  
Next, I brought up the Bear's paper and pencil and his paw underneath his paper.  I used the black colored pencil with a very sharp and deliberate point -- but again it is how the pencil is USED --  NOT the PRESSURE.   Draw without pressure or you will BITE into the surface.  
The green of the background is now mellowed out with light applications of RED.  There is Blue added to the background in the upper left.  The color of the background has been changed throughout by VERY LIGHTLY layering several different colors over the green in different amounts in different places.  The gradation of color is achieved with light applications that are transitioned slowly and gradually.  No PRESSURE here!!!

		<span class="number">4.</span> The Bunny now wears some RED.  That's right . . . the Bunny got some more color -- especially in the shadows inside her ears and in most - but not all - places that she is/was green.  The red is the <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=opposite_colors" target="_blank">opposite</a> of green and it will add lots of fun drama while sinking the green BACK into her ears and around the bottom of her back leg and tail.  Bunny's lips remain RED and her body white.
The colored pencils laid out on the drawing show the four colors that I'm using here to make the background pattern "move and groove" -- AND stay back!!!

		<span class="number">5.</span> ENTER the <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=foreground" target="_blank">foreground</a>!  On the left and the right of the bottom of the picture -- behind the Flower -- (foreground!) -- I have darkened the receding parts of this pattern creating a <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=darkest_dark_and_lightest_light" target="_blank">"darkest dark and lightest light"</a> effect that is characteristic of foreground.  Note the almond shaped ball on the right bottom -- later it will be manipulated again to be a blue sphere that is rising up from below the picture plane.  This image of a blue sphere shows up again and again in my paintings.  You may find that you keep repeating your own images in your own drawings. You want to note what seems to "just happen" often in your own images and compositions.  It will happen and you want to be aware enough to recognize it when it does happen!!! (See #6) I'm going to continue to mix RED on top of that bottom green (on the right) to keep it dulled out but still vibrant and LOADED with an interplay of color.

		<span class="number">6.</span>More development on the lower right corner -- yellow gets placed on the tops of the ridges.  On the left I begin to work in the deeper parts of the pattern to make a good transition UP on the left side back behind the Butterfly.  The foreground is pretty well set now -- it has HIGH <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=contrasts_(color)" target="_blank">contrasts</a>: value, color and intensity or saturation. 
Note that the color on both sides of the Flower under the petals is the same or almost the same.  Check this out and look until you see what I mean.  When both colors on either side of a form are the same - they sort of reach around BEHIND the form and grab each other.  This visually pushes them BACK and then the Flower in front of them is visually forced FORWARD.  Dimension!!!  So check each side of your forms and see if you can match the colors there so they will perform this visual task for you!

		<span class="number">8.</span>Now for the Butterfly.  Whenever you get a chance -- sweeten your blacks with BLUE - or another color.  I left little teeny thin white streaks in the Butterfly's black antennae amidst the black and then brought in the BLUE inside of the black.  The BLUE could have gone on first and then the black.  The orange in the wings is <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=modeled" target="_blank">modeled</a> with some very light blue (its opposite color) as well as yellow and orange.  Look at the shape of yellow-orange in the wings and see that they are not all one color.  Be sure to put in variation while keeping things the <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=same_color" target="_blank">"same color"</a> -- you will infuse your colors and forms with LIFE!

		<span class="number">9.</span> I laid in all the YELLOW-ORANGE of the wings FIRST before I put much or any of the adjacent black down.  If the orange-yellow (being light and much lighter than the black) had picked up specks or edges of the black -- it would have left streaks of black that couldn't be removed to covered.  So that is also a caution when working with colored pencil (and most other graphic mediums) -- work from your lightest colors to your darker colors.  Once a dark goes down -- it is usually there to stay.  Wait on the darker colors and most outlines - they can always go in at the end.

		<span class="number">10.</span>Made further adjustments here -- now bringing in some RED (a darker color) into the yellow-orange (a lighter color).  I also did some final detailing with the black making the edges of the black around the white spots have the best edges possible.  I also <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=rework" target="_blank">reworked/modified</a> the orange lines in the back wing with the black to make them look like they wrap back around the back edge of the wing -- even though that isn't really what happens on the "real wing".  But I liked it for this drawing.

I had said that I was only going to use the small set of 12 colors.  Oops!  I may have borrowed a couple of new colors from bigger Prismacolor sets! The more the merrier but it is still not necessary to have huge sets -- although it can be nice!
Note the darker PINKS in the under-petals.  You see in the photo of the Flower that they are in shadow -- but they are still PINK albeit a darker PINK and they are not blue or black as many may associate with shadows.

		<span class="number">12.</span>Here I am about to start at the BASE of the Flower or you might say the TOP of the stem.  I have just put in an underlayment of pink.  The pink will  be the base that green will later be drawn over.  The first layer of pink will give a unification to the subsequent layers that will go on top of the pink.

		<span class="number">13.</span>Around the pink on the stem I did put a black outline to see if that would separate the base of the flower from the far ground.  It did work!  I also added a light brown to one of the center "scallops".  I added it to the one on the right.

		<span class="number">14.</span>I finalized this area with greens that go to the dulled down side of green - the olive side of green.  On top of that I added the turquoise blue that is also in the Bear.  This will draw the blue of the Bear down -- and/or draw the blue of the Flower base up.  There is also a triangular unity or association created because the butterfly has blue in his legs and antennae.  This pulls the blue around from Flower base to Butterfly to Bear.  With the blue being in 3 different locations it is a color association that creates <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=geometry" target="_blank">geometry</a>, unifies and moves the composition.

Using all the pencil colors that are shown in number eleven above, the lower petals are given the colors that will show shadows.  These colors are drawn under the flower and under the Bear.  Some of the bottom layers of colors are <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary&word=neutralize" target="_blank">neutralized</a> or dulled down with layers of different greens and some blues.
I also added some browns and oranges into the Bear's fur under his whiskers that are behind his muzzle.  These oranges and browns were also added to his lower back, his stomach and under his rear and rear leg.

		you draw!  Draw like a child with no expectations beyond your current beginner's 
		brain, eyes, hands and heart.  Orient your focus toward the fascination that consumes 
		a small child upon discovering that she can make her own marks appear.   Make your 
		own marks appear!!
