<p><b>Question:  What is an ezine?</b></p>

<p>Answer: An ezine is an Electronic MagaZINE -- thus called an E-ZINE. The DrawingFree Ezine is created to start (or further) your own art making enjoyment and development. It is designed to give you ideas and simple steps to work with to increase your ability and confidence to make your own art.  You can make your own art using the guidance of the DrawingFree Ezine. The DrawingFree Ezine is FR*EE.</p>

<p><b>Question: Why is the DrawingFree Ezine called DrawingFree?</b></p>  

<p>Answer: Drawing is the root of all the visual the arts.  Now for the second part of DrawingFREE.  Janis Joplin belted out, "Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't fr*ee".  And she didn't mean the cost!  She meant what the Beatles meant when they wrote and sang the lyrics, "One thing I can tell you is you've got to be free".  DrawingFree works to teach you to draw freely without self-judgement or self-critisism.
</p>

<p><b>Question: What will the DrawingFree Ezine do for me?</b></p>

<p>Learning to Draw with the DrawingFree Ezine will increase your over all everyday creativity.  The DrawingFree Ezine will allow you to draw and make art with more ease, fun and freedom.  Creativity lives when it is unbounded and fr*ee to roam.  DrawingFree Ezine presents art making ideas that all levels of ability can enjoy including the absolute beginner.  DrawingFree Ezine is created to bring more creativity and visual self-expression into your life.  DrawingFree Ezine is carefully constructed to demystify learning to draw.  Each DrawingFree Ezine puts art and art terms into plain language that is easy to grasp.  Each issue points to a <a href="http://www.drawingfree.com/index.php?frame=glossary" target="_blank">GLOSSARY PAGE</a> that explains words that are associated with art that are contained in that issue.  DrawingFree brings you open ended art processes that are easy to understand and easy to do.</p> 

<p>The DrawingFree Ezine also gives you a way to let go of STRESS and move into the RELAXED ZONE of making art just for the fun of making marks that are your very own marks.  People using the DrawingFree methods report a sense of letting go, relaxing and forgetting the problems of their day when they let their creative brain take over by making art.   Students can arrive at art class frustrated, exhausted and drained by their day.  Within minutes of letting the watercolor flow or watching the line that they are drawing develop they are HAPPY and REJUVENATED.  The more the colors move and the lines flow -- the more mellow they become!</p>

<p><b>How Margaret Welty, M.A. the creator of the DrawingFree Ezine came to create DrawingFree:</b></p>

<p>Close to twenty years ago I unknowingly embarked on a journey to learn how to teach people to teach themselves to draw.  In the beginning I used what most teachers were using at the time and I was shocked at the results.  It seemed that there was very little positive or immediate evidence of anyone truly learning to draw .  It was very slow going.  In desperation, I finally resorted to assigning a high school project of copying a photograph using tiny dots.  Even that did not work with the majority of the students.  Lots of trying to draw but little drawing progress.  Despite the methods, after about 15 weeks of drawing classes most of the students began to shift and make progress in their drawings.  I was curious when magically everyone seemed to begin to thrive and their drawings progressed.  That was long before the brain research methods that we have today began to prove what I suspected about learning to draw. All my classroom observation, experimentation and intuitive notions led me to believe that we have to create new neural pathways throughout our brain, eyes and hands in order to draw and think visually.  Today I call this "creating the <b>drawing brain</b> or the <b>art brain</b> or the <b>visual brain</b>".  The drawing brain that we create through using the DrawingFree methods is composed of newly formed and illuminated  brain constellations and connections that are essential for drawing and learning to draw.  As we practice all sorts of drawing by playing with art materials we begin to build our drawing brains.  The DrawingFree Ezine is designed to give you ways to practice making art that will add up to the skills that you need to draw and see in a new artistic way.  DrawingFree is here to help you expand your artistic and creative self.</p>

		<b><span style="font-size:13px;">DRAWING FREE - ART FROM THE START</span> <br /> Presented by Margaret Welty and the Drawing Dog</b>
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Each lesson presented in the Drawing Free Ezine gives you ways to massage your own 
		neurological white matter to further form and train your ever transitioning ART BRAIN.  
		Remember that the key is to DRAW, play and be easy with yourself.  Eliminate any 
		unrealistic expectations and judgements about your work.  Work to be happy while 
		you draw!  Draw like a child with no expectations beyond your current beginner's 
		brain, eyes, hands and heart.  Orient your focus toward the fascination that consumes 
		a small child upon discovering that she can make her own marks appear.   Make your 
		own marks appear!!  
		</p>
		
		<p style="padding-left:110px;font-size:12px;"><i>Create a chance to draw.  Draw every chance you get.  <br />
		Make a space to draw.  Draw in every space you make.</i>
