It was started and completed for the first time in 1997 and shown in a four-person show at Solomon Dubnick Gallery in Sacramento.  Over the past three years I re-painted it and finished it again for this show.  It is 60 inches X 96 inches unframed.</p>

			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;"><b>Night Nest - How we are Held Between Heaven and Earth in the Night</b></p>
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">“Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm<br />
			‘Come in . . . I'll give you shelter from the storm’.”<br />
			Bob Dylan</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">My work points to where we go to rest and sleep in the time <br />
			between the last light of day and the early light of morning.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">The imagery in my paintings and drawings comes from such nesting metaphors as incubation, transformation, birth and flight.  Spiraling motion and density have their own play within my work as well.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">Looking at nests as a compilation of all things collected and built – their structure, form and shape are our own original and transitioning assemblage.  Our nests form our safe night space from which we can emerge each day anew.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">I have constructed conceptual, abstracted NESTS in paint and drawing media.  In a more or less literal sense I have also included natural brush, landscape and the waters of rivers and streams.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">It is my feeling that where we, “lay me down to sleep”, is crucial to our dreaming, growth, power and expression.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">The imagery of the nest creates an encircling space that supports, cradles and revives.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:Helvetica Neue;">Night Nest is a place to connect, create and dream in the dark.</p>
